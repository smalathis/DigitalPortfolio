The main objective of the Department is to inculcate the basic concepts and <br>
application of Biochemistry in the student and to flourish in the field of <br>
research and development. The secret of the success lies in its academic <br>
environment and the close ties between teachers and students. Since its <br>

field of Biochemistry. It is mandatory for the students to undergo laboratory <br>
training in reputed hospitals at the end of the second year. The department <br>
has produced University Ranks continuously from the year of inception to till<br>
